# Template Portfolio
This will be your portfolio website. Use this as a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) and customize it to your own tastes. We gave you a starting point with a space to describe yourself and a link to where your assignment 1 file can be. For an example of how a portfolio site can look, [check out this example by our amazing TA, Erin!](https://erinliu1.github.io/61040-portfolio/) You can see this page live with GitHub Pages [here](https://61040-fa25.github.io/template-portfolio/)!
